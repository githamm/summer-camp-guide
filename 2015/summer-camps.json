    "Description":"From “Wild Nestlings” (a day camp for 2-5 year olds + Accompanying Adults) to “On the Wing” (a 10-day overnight camp for teens), RMBO’s Summer Nature Camps are designed in a progression to introduce young children to the outdoors and build their skills over time. They also learn behaviors and actions they can take to contribute to active, healthy lifestyles and a healthy natural world. \n\nRMBO's camp offerings for the summer of 2015 include:\n\n•\tWild Nestlings Day Camps – Ages 2 to 5 + Accompanying Adults – Cost: $5/Day - Parents are always asking when they can attend camp, and now they can, at least with their toddlers! Meeting on Tuesday mornings (9-11am) in July, this camp provides opportunities for toddlers and their parents to learn new ways of exploring the natural world together. Puppet shows, songs, stories, crafts, snacks and other activities will make each day an exciting learning experience for both the young and young-at-heart. Campers may be registered for an individual session, a combination of sessions, or for all of them, in order to accommodate summer schedules. \n\n•\tYoung Naturalists Day Camps – Ages 4 and 5 – Cost: $15/Day - During the last four Wednesday mornings (9am-12pm) in July, RMBO’s youngest independent campers will gain appreciation for nature while engaging all of their senses and observational skills in the world around them at Barr Lake State Park. Campers will also gain a basic understanding of the natural world through crafts, scavenger hunts, games, exploration, and other hands-on activities, including an hour of supervised, outdoor nature play. Campers may be registered for an individual session, a combination of sessions, or for all of them, in order to accommodate summer schedules.\n\n•\tNature Investigators Day Camps – Ages 6 and 7 – Cost: $20/Day - During the last four Thursdays (9am-1pm) in July, campers will expand upon their foundational understandings of the natural world by investigating more closely various types of plants and animals that are found at Barr Lake State Park. Campers will have opportunities to continue learning about these different topics through short hikes, crafts, games, scavenger hunts, and candid exploration. They will continue exploring during a lunch-hour of supervised, unstructured outdoor nature play with their new friends. Campers may be registered for an individual session, a combination of sessions, or for all of them, in order to accommodate summer schedules.\n\n•\tHabitat Explorers Day Camp – Ages 8 and 9 – Cost: $35/Day - During the last four Fridays (9:00am-4:00pm) in July, campers will explore the habitats of Barr Lake State Park and discover the special qualities that make it home to such a great diversity of birds and other wildlife. With a focus on birds, campers will utilize binoculars, field guides, and other scientific and observational equipment to look at the world around them more closely. Campers will continue their explorations during a lunch-hour of supervised, unstructured outdoor nature play with their new friends. Campers may be registered for an individual session, a combination of sessions, or for all of them, in order to accommodate summer schedules.\n\n•\tBugabilities/Winged Wonders Camps – Ages 5 to 9 – Cost: $130 for one camp or $245 for both -  In partnership with the Butterfly Pavilion, which will be leading  the afternoon sessions (1:00-4:00pm) of “Bugabilities,” RMBO is offering morning sessions (9:00am-12:00pm) of “Winged Wonders,” so that campers will have the opportunity to choose whether they would like to learn about bugs, birds, or both, by combining the morning and afternoon sessions for a full day of learning. During this week-long program from August 3-7, campers will learn more about the lives of various winged creatures in the natural world through hikes, exploration, crafts, and hands-on activities. \n\n•\tYoung Ecologists Day Camp – Ages 10 and 11 – During this week-long day camp from June 8-12, campers will begin to hone their bird identification and scientific observation skills by learning what it means to think like an ecologist, drawing relationships between birds and both living and non-living things. Campers will also gain insights into their relationships with themselves, others, and the world around them by hiking, playing games, overcoming challenges, making new friends, and going on field trips. \n\n•\tTaking Flight Overnight Camp - Ages 12 to 14 - Cost: $750 - This camp is for budding birders who want to take their birding skills to the next level and also enjoy outdoor adventure, traditional camp activities, and nature exploration. During this weeklong camp from June 14-19, campers will call a rustic lodge near Rocky Mountain National Park their home and have the opportunity to explore the ecosystems of Colorado’s Front Range, while honing their bird identification and leadership skills, gaining independence and responsibility, and making new friends! \n\n•\tOn the Wing Overnight Camp – Ages 15-17 – Cost: $1,000 – This camp is for teenagers who aspire to careers in natural resources. Based at a residential camp near Rocky Mountain National Park, campers will have the opportunity to design and conduct mini-research projects in the surrounding forests. Campers will work together to develop a hypothesis, collect scientific data, draw conclusions from their data, write technical scientific research papers, and present their findings to a group of natural resource professionals. In addition, campers will take part in traditional camp activities and learn field journaling, field sketching, field guide and binocular use, bird and plant identification, and field biology, by observing and participating in studies of RMBO and NPS biologists. \n\nFor specific dates, additional information, and to register, please visit our website.\n"

She can bow to her fellow campers as they applaud her first bullseye.

Resident camp is returning to this beautiful rustic camp near Manitou Lake and Woodland Park for the first time since 2012. Girl Scouts of Colorado will also offer resident camp at perennial favorite Tomahawk Ranch near Bailey, southwest of Denver. Girls learn differently than boys and everything at Girl Scout camp is designed to meet girls where they are. No labels. No competition. No boys. There’s just a whole lot of “you go, girl!” Registration begins Jan. 13 at 9 a.m. on the Girl Scouts of Colorado website at girlscoutsofcolorado.org. Sign up early.

    "Description":"Overview\nYMCA Camp Jackson is owned and operated by the YMCA of Pueblo and is located in the foothills of Greenhorn Mountain in Rye, Colorado.  45 minutes south of Pueblo, Colorado, Camp Jackson has been serving the community through outdoor programs since 1916.  The 2015 resident summer camp season will operate from June 14th – July 31st for a total of 7 weeks.  \n\nBase Camp (Ages 7-12) \nCampers spend a week in the beautiful Colorado mountains, making new friends, learning new skills and making memories that will last a lifetime. Living in single-gender cabins, campers get a taste of all that camp has to offer, including horse¬back riding, canoeing, “specialty areas,” and an out-of-cabin overnight packout adventure. These exciting outdoor programs are designed to not only give our campers the thrill of a lifetime, but also to teach positive values and life skills. The character of each child grows as our counselors em¬power him/her to be a helpful and caring member in our community.\n\nBase Camp Specialty Areas \nWhen registering for Base Camp, each camper selects a specialty area of their choice. Every morning, campers will participate in their specialty area. During the week, campers will have the opportunity to try the other specialty area activities during “choice time.” Campers select one of the following “Specialty Areas”; Marksmanship, Eco Survival Challenge, Mountain Sports or Horsemanship. \n\nExtreme Teen Camps (Ages 12-14 and Ages 14-17)\nTeens are drawn to YMCA Camp Jackson Extreme camps, not just to participate in awesome outdoor adventures in Colorado’s wilderness, but for the thrill of personal achievement and team success. Extreme trips cover more than just terrain and rapids, they’re personal journeys that bring out the best each teen has to offer.  Teen Paddling focuses on white water rafting on the Arkansas River, Teen Terrain focuses on white water rafting and rock climbing, Teen Riding is an advanced horsemanship camp and Teen Combo is a two week combination of all programs.\n\nTeen Leadership Camps (Ages 13-14 and 15-17)\nYMCA Camp Jackson’s Leadership Camps are designed to give teens the life skills of leadership. Campers progress through our programs, learning the skills necessary to be¬come great leaders and maybe one day, great camp staff!  Camp Jackson offers Leaders in Training, Counselors in Training and a service based Crew programs.  \n\n\n"
