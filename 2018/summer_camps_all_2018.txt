    "descriptionDetailed": "Why TRAINOC ? A lifelong love of fitness starts HERE  It’s no secret that kids today don’t move nearly as much as they used to. With advances and technology and the decline of school sponsored physical education programs, children spend more hours than ever sitting in desks or on the couch staring at tiny glowing screens. Fewer and fewer children experience fitness as their parents and grandparents did- as outdoor play. Remember climbing trees, jumping from log to log and scampering up hills playing “King of the Mountain”? The imaginative games of childhood did more than help to pass the time with friends on a long summer day.  They also helped to inspire a lifelong love of moving and assisted in well-rounded motor learning (the development of the neuromuscular system).  We make fitness FUN!  Of course safety is our #1 priority, but FUN is a very close second! If your kids like American Ninja Warrior, they’ll LOVE Train OC’s Summer Camp programs. What’s Included:  Full day of obstacle course instruction from our expert staff A variety of fitness skill challenges and movement mastery games Dog Tag medal at the end day of camp"

They will witness mature men in a council circle, speaking truth, listening with heart, and providing support for each other.  Fathers will be encouraged to share stories of their own boyhoods, to express some of the joys and fears, and to help their sons to recognize the manhood that awaits them. Boys will be gently invited to talk about their lives, their hopes and dreams; the stories that draw them.  This gathering has become a tradition that gently and joyfully guides boys into their adolescence and manhood. We believe the passage into manhood to be one of the most important transitions a boy will make, and this retreat serves as a foundation for that transition."

Unlike any camp, this unique program allows you to explore leadership concepts and build confidence alongside more than 120 of Denver’s most dynamic and accomplished business leaders. In addition to interactive workshops on marketing, business ethics and budgeting, the week culminates in a competition rivaled only by “Shark Tank.”  Students attending for the first time will work on designing a new cell phone case and marketing plan for OtterBox, an electronics accessory company headquartered in Fort Collins. Returning students will work as consultants for Arrow Electronics.  Students returning for the third or fourth time will dive deeply into what it takes to start their own business right now, with the guidance of three young entrepreneurs who figured it all out on their own."
