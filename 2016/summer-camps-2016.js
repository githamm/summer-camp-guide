Sessions are open to beginners interested in learning the basics to more advanced students exploring their passions for the craft."

Our top-notch instructors will offer courses in skills that all our ancestors had a knack for. This once-common knowledge, aeons old, is quickly becoming lost as we trade \"up\" in technology. As we become more specialized, we lose sight of the simple pleasures of picking a fresh salad near a mountain stream, making a stone into a sharp tool, weaving a basket to carry our things, or creating beautiful clothing. And as we lose this knowledge, we become dependent, we lose our options, and a part of us dies. We feel this knowledge contains the marrow of life: the spark, the knack for living in harmony with ourselves and the Earth.\n\nAt the Earth Knack Gathering, you will learn the science–the step-by-step process–that enables you to gather and make everything you need from your surroundings. You'll meet kindred spirits as you gain fun and useful skills that you can incorporate into your modern lifestyle. Together we will learn the skills of bow-and-arrow, atlatl, blacksmithing, basketry, pottery, fire-making, outdoor cooking, plant-fiber cordage, wild edibles, medicinal plants, beekeeping, natural gardening, soap-making, natural building, livestock, flintknapping, hide tanning, and much more!\n\nStop simply watching and hearing about it...Get out here and really try it!\nCLASSES IN:\nBLACKSMITHING, WEAVING, POTTERY, FIRE MAKING, BOW AND ARROW, ATLATL, OUTDOOR COOKING, WILD EDIBLES, MEDICINAL PLANTS, CORDAGE, BEE KEEPING, GARDENING, SOAP MAKING, NATURAL BUILDING, LIVE STOCK, BASKETRY, FLINTKNAPPING, HIDE TANNING,\n﻿AND MUCH MORE...."
