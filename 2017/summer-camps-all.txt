They will learn to halter, lead, groom, bridle, tack, and ride their horse. They will ride the same horse all week so as to build a trusting relationship. They will also ride in helmets, and on bareback pads to build balance and to feel the horse's movement beneath them. Campers will also have a daily guitar lesson with an accomplished instructor. They will each build a Native American themed dream catcher, paint, and create a horse-themed photo frame. Campers will also learn to handle, groom and care for several small animals: goats, chickens and sheep. Lastly, campers will also have the opportunity to spin a lariat, rope a robo-calf, and ride the giant rope swing! Hay rides, picnic lunches, and popsicles are daily highlights here at Horses & More Summer Camp. Knowledgeable, caring instructors comprised of teachers, education majors, agricultural majors, music majors, and equestrian experts, will provide a positive learning experience for your camper.

All campers will be housed in the newly renovated dorms on the historic University of Colorado at Boulder Campus.   Campers will get a true feel of the beautiful Boulder Campus and surrounding area as the camp will feature five different courses around Boulder.  The featured course will be CU Men’s and Women’s home course Colorado National Golf Club.  Curriculum will focus on the fundamentals of the game, not limited to just swing mechanic fundamentals, but the whole game.  Each camper will take home a scrapbook filled with lesson notes along with a videotaped game analysis with our Assistant Coach and former All-American Pat Grady.  Our goal is to offer first class golf instruction all while providing an experience the campers will never forget.  We look forward to seeing you at the 2016 Buffalo Golf Camp.  Go Buffs!"

Gymnastics is a strenuous sport, and can be difficult when kids are physically very tired.  We want kids to have a fun and safe experience, so we limit our gymnastics time to the equivalent of 2 classes per day.  Don’t worry, we will keep the kids active the rest of the day with games, relays, obstacle courses, and other fun activities!\n\nWhat should kids wear?  Campers should wear comfortable, athletic clothing (no jeans or buttons please!) and dress in layers, as they may get hot or cold during different activities.·\n\nWhat about lunch?  Lunch will be around noon, with snacks given mid-morning and mid-afternoon.· We will provide the snacks, but parents are responsible for sending campers their own BAG LUNCH.· Please remember to let us know if your child has any food allergies as we are providing snacks!\n\nVisit our website for more information!"

As we become more specialized, we lose sight of the simple pleasures of picking a fresh salad near a mountain stream, making a stone into a sharp tool, weaving a basket to carry our things, or creating beautiful clothing. And as we lose this knowledge, we become dependent, we lose our options, and a part of us dies. We feel this knowledge contains the marrow of life: the spark, the knack for living in harmony with ourselves and the Earth.\n\nAt the Earth Knack Gathering, you will learn the science–the step-by-step process–that enables you to gather and make everything you need from your surroundings. You'll meet kindred spirits as you gain fun and useful skills that you can incorporate into your modern lifestyle. Together we will learn the skills of bow-and-arrow, atlatl, blacksmithing, basketry, pottery, fire-making, outdoor cooking, plant-fiber cordage, wild edibles, medicinal plants, beekeeping, natural gardening, soap-making, natural building, livestock, flintknapping, hide tanning, and much more!\n\nStop simply watching and hearing about it...Get out here and really try it!\nCLASSES IN:\nBLACKSMITHING, WEAVING, POTTERY, FIRE MAKING, BOW AND ARROW, ATLATL, OUTDOOR COOKING, WILD EDIBLES, MEDICINAL PLANTS, CORDAGE, BEE KEEPING, GARDENING, SOAP MAKING, NATURAL BUILDING, LIVE STOCK, BASKETRY, FLINTKNAPPING, HIDE TANNING,\n﻿AND MUCH MORE...."

Our day camp for boys and girls aged 8 – 12, focuses on developing each camper’s curiosity, self-esteem, problem solving, and communication skills.  We offer a full week of learning about horses and donkeys, how to be safe in their presence, and community building with each other and another species. Each camper is responsible for taking care of their “special horse” with grooming, daily feeding and clean up.   Our days are filled with horse activities, art projects, journal writing, and learning fun things about nature."

We offer STEM-based after-school programs at both public and private schools, game jam events, and summer camps - all teaching kids engineering and social skills through building video games. \n\nWe leverage our student’s existing passions for Minecraft and videogames to teach them how to code: first by building mods in Minecraft and then by creating their own unique RPG, FPS, Platformer, 2D, or VR adventure games in Unity, a leading commercial game development engine. We fill a much-needed gap between existing elementary school teaching tools like Scratch, Hopscotch, or Agentsheets and Java or C# programming courses offered in high school or college.\n\nDreamQuest Academy is unique in that it’s instructors are all professional game developers and that it grew out of an existing game development studio, DreamQuest Games, which Christopher Williamson founded in 2000. Christopher has a Masters in Software Engineering from CU-Boulder and a Bachelors in Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology from the University of Maryland.  Under Christopher’s direction, DreamQuest Games shipped over 50 successful game titles on desktop, mobile, and console gaming platforms over the past 15 years.\n\n“My daughter was frustrated with the quality of instruction she was getting at other gaming camps,” says Christopher, “and she convinced me that I could do better. I had no idea at that time that in just 2 years it would end up eclipsing my game development business.”"

This program includes eight 3hr. and 35 minutes classroom sessions and one homework assignment  and meets the Colorado State requirements for teens to obtain their permit at age 15. It is also excellent for older students. The classroom sessions cover all areas of safe driving. Students will take the permit test during Class 8  (no more than 30 days before the 15th birthday). After students have received their permit, they will complete the driving instruction portion of the program at the Greenwood Village DriveSafe location (or any of our  nine locations). Students are required to complete 6 hours of behind-the-wheel instruction. Each driving lesson is two hours, one-on-one, and takes place in a DriveSafe vehicle. Drives increase in complexity and can be customized to each student’s needs. Drive tests are conducted at any DriveSafe location after students have held their permit for one year. Defensive Skills Days are held at a driving range where students can practice skills they can’t practice on the roadway. Ideally the Defensive Skills Day should be taken when your student has his/her permit for 3-7 months.\n\nDriveSafe Driving Schools has been a leading provider of Driver’s Education for over 20 years. As an education company, DriveSafe partners with parents in providing a complete driving education and will tailor the program to meet each student’s needs."

Enter Lucretia Fossilwart, scented candle saleswoman and substitute Fairy Godmother. This will not end well. (Or will it?) Join these classic characters in a not-so-classic fairytale with special appearances by Rumpelstiltskin, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and more!

Join Max and his friends for a wonderfully wild adventure as he travels past sea monsters, floats on his small ship on an ocean that happens to tumble by, and finds himself (with his stow-away sister) on the island of the Wild Things.

By participating in daily “Guild Challenges,” every Quester’s writing earns character powers and treasures in the Adventure Quest program that is a part of Quest & Quill. Quest & Quill Summer Quests give the opportunity to write and develop short stories, with the potential to craft a tale to include in the Adventure Quest: Stories publication (released in book stores and Amazon)"
