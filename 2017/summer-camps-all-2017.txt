Girl Scouts of Colorado offers a variety of sessions designed for girls entering first grade through seniors in high school at both Sky High Ranch near Colorado Springs and Tomahawk Ranch southwest of Denver. For summer 2017, your girl can rough-it survivor-style, summon the courage to zip down the zip line, sing and dance with new friends, or even paint a chicken’s toe nails! At “Pioneers” at Tomahawk Ranch, your girl can travel back in time to the1800’s! She’ll learn to cook over a fire, prepare food as her ancestors did, track animals, and make her own soaps and lotion. She can also explore “Oopy Goopy Science” at Sky High Ranch by learning how to launch pop and tea bag rockets, explode watermelons, and make fizzy lemonade to drink. “Dream Team” at Tomahawk Ranch is the ultimate girl-led adventure and leadership challenge! Girls will design their own session by choosing from a variety of activities including: horseback riding, archery, outdoor cooking, hiking, crafts, stargazing, roasting marshmallows around a campfire, and enjoying spa nights! Girls learn differently than boys and everything at Girl Scout Camp is designed to meet girls where they are. No labels. No competition. No boys. There’s just a whole lot of “you go, girl!” Registration begins Jan. 19 at 9 a.m. on the Girl Scouts of Colorado website at girlscoutsofcolorado.org. Sign up early. Some sessions fill in just a few hours."

Unfortunately, we often squash that potential by telling kids what to do, and what to learn.\n\nAt Steve & Kate’s, we believe that when you trust kids, they develop the confidence to trust themselves, and learn to use their own judgment. So we built a summer camp that puts kids in charge. Because unlike traditional schools, summer gives us the freedom to reinvent learning in a way that allows kids to make their own choices – and, of course, a few mistakes along the way.\n\nDriven by this belief, we’ve built our summer camp to put kids in the driver’s seat of a world of possibilities. So whether your child is a natural-born storyteller with a love for animation, or a budding chef, or a hacker-in-training, or a dance machine, they can dive into their passions in a world free from adult judgments and expectations.\n\nAfter 37 years, we are still obsessed with reinventing every summer. Because if we’ve learned one thing, it’s that when you think like a child, anything is possible.\n\n–Steve & Kate"

Our top-notch instructors will offer courses in skills that all our ancestors had a knack for. This once-common knowledge, eons old, is quickly becoming lost as we trade \"up\" in technology. As we become more specialized, we lose sight of the simple pleasures of picking a fresh salad near a mountain stream, making a stone into a sharp tool, weaving a basket to carry our things, or creating beautiful clothing. And as we lose this knowledge, we become dependent, we lose our options, and a part of us dies. We feel this knowledge contains the marrow of life: the spark, the knack for living in harmony with ourselves and the Earth.\n\nAt the Earth Knack Gathering, you will learn the science–the step-by-step process–that enables you to gather and make everything you need from your surroundings. You'll meet kindred spirits as you gain fun and useful skills that you can incorporate into your modern lifestyle. Together we will learn the skills of bow-and-arrow, atlatl, blacksmithing, basketry, pottery, fire-making, outdoor cooking, plant-fiber cordage, wild edibles, medicinal plants, beekeeping, natural gardening, soap-making, natural building, livestock, flintknapping, hide tanning, and much more!\n\nStop simply watching and hearing about it...Get out here and really try it!"

This drawing and painting class not only will provide great instruction in drawing and painting but gives the girls in this class the opportunity to contribute some brightness to the lives of underserved women in our community through with their creativity.  The class will be structured to provide learning and practice in drawing, painting and compositional techniques culminating in painted works to be donated to the clients at a community center.   We will use inspiration from the world around us to design what kind of drawing or painting we will work on for our final product.  On Friday, we will invite friends and family to join us to see what we’ve been working on all week and we hope to present our creations to our community partner also at that time."

The secret land of Narnia challenges the children to discover who they truly are as they battle the White Witch to end the eternal winter. In this main stage production of Narnia, the emerging performer will be challenged to look at character creation, develop relationships both on and off stage, understand the importance of story development, engage in stage combat, and more. Though this production offers a myriad of characters and staging opportunities, it is important that actors know that not all performers will receive the part of their choice, but all ensemble members will be given lots of stage time and intensive learning of the performance process and techniques. Please also note that this production will have required weekend rehearsals and performances. Our week will begin with a rehearsal on Sunday, June 25th."

The goal of the camp is to get students excited about possible careers in engineering (i.e., mechanical, electrical, computer, mechatronics, and bioengineering), mathematics, and other sciences, with an aim of increasing matriculation into college programs in engineering, math, and the sciences.  In addition, the camp aims to help students understand the need for mathematics and science; and thereby increase motivation for such knowledge. \n\nStudents will spend 8 hours per day in a variety of classes and hands-on workshops. Much of this will include learning about the necessary design, math, and engineering fundamentals to develop automated robots.  The students will create several robots during the camp that will navigate different events. Other hands-on activities during the week will highlight engineering principles and tools, and focus on design and teamwork. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from different faculty members and graduate students whom work in various research laboratories. This curriculum is designed and will be primarily delivered by university professors who are experts in teaching and research in electrical, mechanical, bio, and computer engineering. The university professors will be assisted by undergraduate and graduate students who have been trained prior to camp by the professors. The additional personnel ensure that there is low student-to-faculty ratio and that each student has an opportunity to learn all the material.  \n\nParents are responsible for being on time when dropping off and picking up camp students.  Students are to be dropped off between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. and picked up between 5:00 and 5:15 pm outside of the Engineering and Computer Science Building at 2155 E. Wesley Ave, Denver 80210.  There is free on-street parking around the building for those who will be driving themselves.  There is also the University light-rail stop on the north end of campus, about a 20-minute walk from the Engineering Building.\n\nStudents are supervised the entire time they are in the camp. Please note that a sample schedule of activities is attached. All students are expected to participate in all planned activities.  \n\nThe fee for this program is $495, which includes all lunches and snacks throughout the day. Full refunds will be given if the request is made more than 30 days from the beginning of camp.  Refunds will not be given after this point. \n\nThere are scholarships for those with financial need.
